# badbankcapstone

8/27
Current progress on one of two capstone project choices for my bootcamp cohort.
The options are to build a banking app or to build a restaurant app. I believe I will ultimately submit the restaurant app
but I am going ahead and building both.

All functionality/styling currently implemented needs refactoring but is working thus far:
some of the code for the backend was borrowed from: https://www.mongodb.com/languages/mern-stack-tutorial

Landing Page
Login/Create an Account form
Login will find user in the database
Create an Account will add an account to the database.
